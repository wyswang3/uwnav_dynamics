\section{Control-Oriented Dynamics Abstraction}

Rather than identifying full hydrodynamic parameters, we model the system response as
\begin{equation}
\bx_{k+1} = f_\theta(\bx_k, \bu_k, \bh_k),
\end{equation}
where $\bh_k$ represents latent hydrodynamic memory states.

The latent dynamics are defined as
\begin{equation}
\bh_{k+1} = \bm{\alpha} \odot \bh_k + g_\theta(\bx_k, \bu_k),
\end{equation}
with element-wise decay factors $\bm{\alpha} \in (0,1)$ ensuring stability.

This structure captures wake effects, added mass, and other unmodeled fluid interactions.
