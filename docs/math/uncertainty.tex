\section{Heteroscedastic Uncertainty Modeling}

Sensor noise and environmental disturbances are state-dependent and non-stationary.
We therefore model predictive uncertainty explicitly.

For a predicted variable $y$, the network outputs $(\hat{y}, \hat{\sigma}_y)$.
Training minimizes the negative log-likelihood:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{NLL}} =
\frac{\|y - \hat{y}\|^2}{\hat{\sigma}_y^2}
+ \log \hat{\sigma}_y^2.
\end{equation}

This formulation allows the model to adaptively down-weight unreliable observations
and provides uncertainty estimates usable by downstream controllers.
