\section{Sensor Models}

\subsection{Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)}

The accelerometer measures the specific force:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\ba} = \ba - \bR_{bn} \bg + \bb_a + \bn_a,
\end{equation}
where $\bg$ is the gravity vector, $\bb_a$ the accelerometer bias, and $\bn_a$ measurement noise.

The gyroscope measurement is given by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\bw} = \bw + \bb_\omega + \bn_\omega.
\end{equation}

Bias terms are modeled as random walks.

\subsection{Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)}

The DVL provides low-frequency planar velocity observations:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\bv} = \bv + \bn_v,
\end{equation}
where $\bn_v$ is non-Gaussian and subject to dropouts.
Quality indicators are used to gate valid observations.
