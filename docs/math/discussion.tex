\section{Discussion}

The proposed framework prioritizes control usability over full physical fidelity.
While not replacing high-fidelity CFD models, it offers a practical compromise
between interpretability, stability, and deployment efficiency.

Future work includes extension to full 6-DOF dynamics and online adaptation.
