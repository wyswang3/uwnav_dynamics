\section{Modeling Assumptions}

\subsection{Time-Scale Assumptions}

The system is considered at a discrete-time resolution aligned with the control loop.
Hydrodynamic effects are assumed to be locally stationary within a short prediction horizon.

\subsection{Observability Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Planar velocity is intermittently observable through DVL measurements.
  \item Attitude and angular velocity are provided by the onboard IMU fusion algorithm.
  \item Vertical motion and roll/pitch dynamics are not explicitly modeled.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applicability Domain}

The proposed model targets low-to-moderate speed underwater robots operating in structured environments.
Highly aggressive maneuvers and full 6-DOF coupling are outside the current scope.
