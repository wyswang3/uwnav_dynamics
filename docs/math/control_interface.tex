\section{Interface to Control Algorithms}

At each control step, the model provides
\begin{equation}
(\hat{\bx}_{k+1:k+H}, \hat{\Sigma}_{k+1:k+H}),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\Sigma}$ denotes predictive uncertainty.

This interface is compatible with MPC and model-based RL algorithms,
which may incorporate uncertainty for risk-sensitive decision making.
