\section{Multi-Step Rollout and Stability}

Single-step accuracy is insufficient for control.
Errors compound during rollout and may destabilize predictive controllers.

The latent-state formulation with bounded decay ensures internal stability,
while uncertainty estimates grow with prediction horizon, reflecting reduced confidence.
